Content first DOM-based parser
==============================

This is a content first DOM-based parser, written in CoffeeScript.

Installing
----------

There is nothing to it, simply fork or clone the repository locally. You can then use it in a local project to process content first HTML.

Running tests
-------------

All tests are browser based and written in Jasmine. Best bet is to start a [node based static webserver][static] in root directory and navigate to http://localhost:8080/test/SpecRunner.html.
