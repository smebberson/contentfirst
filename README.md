Content first
=============

A repository to explore the idea of content first processing.

What is content first?
----------------------
Content first processing allows one to define four layers of metadata to text:

- context / devices
- hierachy
- presentation

Content first processing then filters the text on the first layer so that text, not only HTML can be appropriate changed based on the device in which the user is viewing the text (i.e. just like responsive design provices for layout and aestheic).
